# An Introduction to Python: 1. Getting Started

## 1. What is Python?

Python is a versatile programming language compatible with a wide range of operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, Linux, and Android. As an interpreted language, Python can execute commands directly, eliminating the need for compilation.

## 2. Why Python?

- **Versatility**: Python is one of the fastest-growing programming languages globally due to its versatility and ease of use. It's suitable for various applications, from app development to advanced math.
- **Community Support**: Python is free, open-source, and backed by a large community of programmers. This vast support community ensures that solutions to common problems are readily available.
- **Academic Preference**: Python has become the go-to computing language in academia. It offers the same (or even better) functionality and simplicity as other paid software like MatLab and Mathematica, but for free.
- **Real-world Applications**: [Consider adding examples of companies or applications that use Python.]

## 3. Installation

- **Anaconda Distribution**: We recommend the Anaconda distribution of Python for this course. It bundles many essential packages for engineers and scientists.
- **Installation Steps**:
  1. Visit [Anaconda's download page](https://www.anaconda.com/download).
  2. Download the installer.
  3. Follow the onscreen instructions. It's simplest to use default locations and options for everything.

## 4. Getting Started with Spyder

- **Launching Spyder**: Once you've installed Anaconda, launch the “Spyder” application. You can find it in your computer's program list or through the “Anaconda Navigator”.
- **Spyder Layout**: Upon opening Spyder, you'll notice three main panels:
  1. **Editor Window (Left)**: Where you can write and save Python scripts.
  2. **Variable Explorer and File Explorer (Top Right)**: Displays variables in use and allows for easy file navigation.
  3. **iPython Console (Bottom Right)**: An interactive Python shell to execute commands.

- **Your First Command**: In the iPython console, type the following command and hit Enter:
  ```python
  print('Hello World')
