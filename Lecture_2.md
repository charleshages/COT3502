# Lecture 2: Data Types, Operators, and Expressions

## Introduction

A **program** is a sequence of instructions (<u> statements </u>) that dictate how to perform a computation.
  - Solve a system of equations
  - Find the roots of a polynomial
  - Search and/or replace text in a document
  - Make a graph/plot of data
  - Process an image

Individual statements can be run in the console

Simplistic hierarchy of a program: Program → Functions → Statements → Quantum Physics → Python Backend.

## Basic Numeric Operators

Python provides basic math operators:

- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division
- `//`: Floor Division
- `**`: Exponentiation

> **Note**: Importance of the order of operations and precedence.

## Data Types

Python introduces basic data types:

- `int` : Integer (e.g., 5, 3)
- `float` : Floating-point numbers (e.g., 3.14)
- `bool` : Booleans (e.g., True, False)
- `str` : Text strings (e.g., 'Hi')

### Type Inheritance and Data Type Conversion

- Conversion functions: `int()`, `float()`, `str()`

## Keywords

Reserved words in Python:

- `False`, `await`, `else`, `import`, `pass`, ... (and so on)

> **Note**: These keywords have special meanings and purposes built into the Python language.

## Boolean Operators

Basic boolean (comparison) operators in Python:

- `==`: Equal
- `!=`: Not equal
- `>` : Greater than
- `<` : Less than
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to
- `<=`: Less than or equal to

Logical operators:

- `or` : Returns True if one of the expressions is true
- `and`: Returns True if both expressions are true
- `not`: Reverses the Boolean result of an expression

## String Operations

String operations in Python:

- `in` or `not in`: Membership Operator
- `+`: Concatenate
- `*`: Repetition
- `[]`: Slicing

> **Note**: Python's zero-based indexing and the importance of capitalization.

## Assignment

Concept of assignment in Python:

- Variables reference values in memory.
- Rules for naming variables.

## iPython Console

Features of the iPython console:

- Caching inputs/outputs.
- Distinction between statements and expressions.
- The role of the `print()` function in displaying results.

## Editor

Using an editor to write and evaluate multiple expressions.
